quantum computing,What is quantum computing and how does it work?,"Quantum computing is a novel approach to computing that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. It works by using quantum bits (qubits) instead of classical bits, enabling the exploitation of quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement to perform certain computations exponentially faster than classical computers.",True,
artificial intelligence,Explain the difference between machine learning and deep learning,"Machine learning is a broader field that encompasses techniques for building systems that can learn and improve from data, while deep learning is a specific subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple hidden layers to learn complex patterns in data.",True,
climate change,What are the main causes of global warming?,"The main causes of global warming are human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture.",True,
space exploration,Why is Mars exploration important for humanity?,"Mars exploration is important for humanity because it can provide insights into the origins and evolution of our solar system, expand our understanding of the potential for life beyond Earth, and pave the way for future human settlements, which could lead to advancements in science, technology, and resources.",True,
renewable energy,What are the advantages of solar power over fossil fuels?,,False,"An error occurred (ThrottlingException) when calling the InvokeModel operation (reached max retries: 4): Too many requests, please wait before trying again."
